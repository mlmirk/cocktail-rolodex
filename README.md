# Cocktail Rolodex

## __App overview__
---
The Cocktail Rolodex is an app that takes and data from third party API calls and displays it to a user. 


## __Once you get to the app__
---
There are two types of users logged in users and non-logged-in users. As a non-logged-in user you have access to a random cocktail button that will generate a random cocktail every click. Additionally you can see all the cocktails saved on the database but you cannot do anythhing with thaose recipes. 

Once you log in via Google Oauth you can now read about some next steps in the application devolpment cycle. You will be able to seach cocktails by name, or generate a random cocktail and then save them to your personal rolodex. From there they are displayed on a seperate page where you can delete or add comments to your cocktail. You can also view all saved cocktails and add one you like from that list.
